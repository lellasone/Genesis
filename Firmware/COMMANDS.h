/*
 * This file contains the command objects used to control genesis. 
 * Each one should correspond to a GCode command. When a GCode

 * one at a time and executed. 
 * 
 * Each command object must have: 
 *  - One public function "execute" which carries out the settings changes. 
 *  - One public function "hold" which instructs the main loop to wait while
 *    the command is being carried out. For commands which do not need a wait,
 *    this can simply return "false" otherwise it should return "true" while
 *    a wait state is required. 
 *
